Storme MVP: Your AI Computer Assistant
Core Concept
An always-listening AI assistant that has full system control to execute complex computer tasks through natural conversation. Think Jarvis, but for your actual workflow.
MVP Feature Set
1. Voice Interface

Wake word: "Hey Storme"
Voice: ElevenLabs "Adam" (professional, confident, slightly British - fits the Jarvis vibe)
Always-on listening with local wake word detection
Natural conversation flow - no rigid commands needed

2. Core Capabilities (MVP)

Email Management: Read, compose, send, search emails
Calendar Operations: Check schedule, create/modify events
Document Access: Open, search, summarize files
Browser Control: Navigate websites, fill forms, extract info
App Launching: Open and control applications
System Commands: Screenshots, window management, file operations

3. Technical Stack
Voice Pipeline:

Local wake word detection (Porcupine/Picovoice)
Speech-to-text (Whisper or Deepgram for speed)
LLM reasoning (Claude or GPT-4)
ElevenLabs TTS output

Computer Control:

macOS: AppleScript + Accessibility API
Windows: PowerShell + UIAutomation
Cross-platform: PyAutoGUI for mouse/keyboard
Email: Microsoft Graph API or Gmail API
Calendar: Same API integration

4. MVP User Flow Example
User: "Hey Storme, can you follow up on the meeting I had today, and say that I would like to spin back on the ideas?"
Storme's Process:

Checks calendar for today's meetings
Identifies attendees
Opens email client
Composes: "Hi [name], following up on our meeting today. I'd like to revisit those ideas we discussed. When works for you to connect again?"
Reads draft aloud: "I've drafted this email, should I send it?"
Sends on confirmation

Scope Limitations (What's NOT in MVP)

❌ Mobile app (desktop only)
❌ Multi-user accounts
❌ Learning from behavior patterns
❌ Proactive suggestions
❌ Integration with 100+ apps (focus on 5-7 core ones)
❌ Custom automation workflows

Key Differentiators

Conversational, not command-based - understands context and intent
Full computer control - not just an API wrapper
Voice-first - hands-free workflow
Task completion - doesn't just tell you how, actually does it

Security & Trust

Local processing where possible
Confirmation prompts for sensitive actions (sending emails, deleting files)
Activity log - transparent about what it's doing
Permissions system - explicit access to email, calendar, files

Success Metrics

Time saved per week per user
Task completion rate without user intervention
Voice command accuracy
User returns daily (retention)

Use Electron + Node.js for unified codebase
This is exactly how apps like VS Code, Slack, and Discord work on both platforms.

Platform-Specific Adapters
Use an adapter pattern for OS-specific operations:
javascript// controllers/system.js
class SystemController {
  constructor() {
    this.adapter = process.platform === 'darwin' 
      ? new MacAdapter() 
      : new WindowsAdapter();
  }

  async openApp(appName) {
    return this.adapter.openApp(appName);
  }

  async getEmails() {
    return this.adapter.getEmails();
  }
}

// adapters/mac.js
class MacAdapter {
  async openApp(appName) {
    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    return exec(`open -a "${appName}"`);
  }
}

// adapters/windows.js
class WindowsAdapter {
  async openApp(appName) {
    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    return exec(`start "" "${appName}"`);
  }
}
Voice Pipeline (Universal)
javascript// All platform-agnostic
- Wake word: @picovoice/porcupine-node
- STT: @deepgram/sdk or openai/whisper
- LLM: @anthropic-ai/sdk or OpenAI
- TTS: elevenlabs-node
Email & Calendar (Universal)
javascript// Microsoft Graph API (works everywhere)
- Outlook/Microsoft 365: @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client

// Gmail (works everywhere)  
- Gmail: googleapis (Node.js)

Building & Distribution
Use electron-builder - builds for both platforms from one config:
json// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:mac": "electron-builder --mac",
    "build:win": "electron-builder --win",
    "build:all": "electron-builder -mw"
  },
  "build": {
    "appId": "com.storme.app",
    "mac": {
      "target": "dmg",
      "category": "public.app-category.productivity"
    },
    "win": {
      "target": "nsis"
    }
  }
}
What Stays 95% Shared
✅ Voice pipeline - completely shared
✅ AI logic - completely shared
✅ Email/Calendar APIs - completely shared
✅ UI - completely shared
✅ File operations - completely shared
What Needs Platform Adapters (~5%)
⚠️ App launching - different commands
⚠️ System automation - different APIs
⚠️ Permissions - different OS dialogs
⚠️ Auto-start - different registry/LaunchAgents
Development Workflow
bash# Develop on your primary OS
npm run dev

# Test on both platforms (use VMs or dual-boot)
npm run build:mac
npm run build:win

# Or use GitHub Actions to build both automatically
Key Benefits

Single codebase: ~95% code reuse
Familiar tools: JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
Easy updates: Push once, works everywhere
Native feel: Electron apps look native
Large community: Tons of Node.js automation libraries

Trade-offs

App size: ~150-200MB (includes Chromium)
Memory: Higher than native apps (~100-150MB idle)
Startup: Slightly slower than pure native

But for an MVP, these trade-offs are 100% worth it for the development speed and maintainability you gain.
Bottom line: Electron + adapter pattern = one codebase, two platforms, fast iteration. Perfect for Storme MVP.
